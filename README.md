Introduction into Coding

Hello world!

Rowena here, I like sunsets, relaxing on the beach with a good book, and photography. I'm also interested in HTML, CSS, and C+ and incorporating those programming systems into my creative projects. Coding and design are my two passions, and I plan to incorporate these passions into future habits.
